####DONE!

####The launcher can be found in the emulators 'Home' folder. (ex. [PS2]Game Name.exe )

####It's as simple as that. You can repeat the process for all your games and add them to your steam library!

**Important Notes**
--------------------
- The Game/ROM path **CANNOT** have spaces! Make sure your game paths and names comply. (ex. G:/Playstation2/Games/God_of_War.iso)

- If ROM's are moved after the launcher is made, the launcher will no longer work. You'll have to create a new launcher with the ROM's new location
