*In order for this program to work correctly the folder hierchy must be as follows.*

1. Please create the following folders and subfolders:

--PS2                   <---We'll refer to this as our emulator's 'Home' folder. (Can be named anything you like. No SPACES!)
   |
   |----|--Emulator     <---Your pcsx2.exe emulator and files.  
   |    |
   |    |--Games        <---Your Game ROM's
   |    |
   |    |--PCSX2Steam   <---This program goes in this folder
   |
   |----Your launchers will be here once created in the following format [PS2]Game Name.exe
   
2. Copy your emulator and its files to the 'Emulator' folder. 

3. Rename the pcsx2-xxxx.exe to pcsx2.exe

4. Copy your games/roms to 'Games' folder

5. Extract the included .zip file to the 'PCSX2Steam' folder
   
###Important Notes:###

- The Game/ROM path CANNOT have spaces! Make sure your game paths and names comply. (ex. G:/Playstation2/Games/God_of_War.iso)

- If ROM's are moved after the launcher is made, the launcher will no longer work. You'll have to create a new launcher with the ROM's new location

**Creating Your Game Launchers**
--------------------------------

1. Open up PCSX-2-Steam.exe

2. Enter the Game's Title in the 'Name' field

3. Click on the 'ICON' button to browse for an icon. (You can opt to not use a custom icon and a generic icon will be used.)

4. Click the 'Browse' button to select a game ROM path

4. Click the 'CREATE' button to compile yourl game auncher.exe

DONE!

The launcher can be found in the Emulators 'Home' folder. ex.( [PS2]Game Name.exe )

It's as simple as that. You can repeat the process for all your games and add them to your steam library!
